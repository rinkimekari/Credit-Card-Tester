## NOTE:
This is the beta version of the future full app. It is most definitely unfinished and will not work correctly.

## Credit-Card-Tester
This console application will automatically check the validity of a credit card number you enter in. It uses the standards for Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express, as well as Luhn's Algorithm.

## Future Updates:
1. More refined animation + logo and prettier UI. Hopefully with color.
2. Add Luhn's Algorithm.
3. Secret!

## V 0.1:
Just the basic UI, and haven't integrated Luhn's algorithm yet. Soon!
